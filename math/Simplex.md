## Define

$$
C = \text{conv} (\{v_1, ..., v_k\}) = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^k \theta_i v_i \ |\ \theta âª° 0, \boldsymbol 1^T \theta=1 \right\}
$$

Simplex represents the simplest possible polytope in any given dimension. Specifically, a $k$-simplex is a $k$-dimensional polytope which is the convex hull of its $k + 1$ vertices. ([polyhedron](./Polyhedron.md))
