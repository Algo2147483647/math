## Properties

- Consistency: A system of axioms is consistent, and both if and only if there is no proposition and its negation can be proven from the axioms of that system.

- Completeness: A system of axioms is complete if and only if every true proposition of the system can be proven from its axioms.


### GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems

- First Incompleteness Theorem: Any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F.
- Second Incompleteness Theorem: For any consistent system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out, the consistency of F cannot be proved in F itself.
