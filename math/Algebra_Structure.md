# Algebra Structure

[TOC]

## Define

An algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set $A$ (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on $A$ (typically binary operations such as addition and multiplication), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.

## Properties

### Automorphism 

An automorphism is simply a bijective homomorphism of a mathematical object with itself.
