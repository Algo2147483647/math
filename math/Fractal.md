## Define

A mathematical [set](./Set.md) $F$ is considered self similar if it can be divided into several non empty disjoint subsets, each of which is a scaled, translated, rotated (and possibly also reflective) version of $F $. Specifically, if the set $F $can be written as
$$
F = \bigcup_{i=1}^{N} w_i(F)
$$
Where $w_i$ is a similarity transformation with a scaling factor less than 1, then $F$ can be considered to have self similarity properties.
