### Christopher Symbol

The Christopher Symbol can compare tensors at different locations on the manifold instead of viewing them in isolation, so the K-Schmidt symbol is also called the connection coefficient.
$$
\var A^i = -\Gamma^i_{kl} A^k \mathrm{d} x^l
$$
Property
$$
\Gamma^k_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \left( \frac{\partial g_{il}}{\partial x^j} + \frac{\partial g_{jl}}{\partial x^i} - \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^l} \right)
$$

### Geodesic equation

$$
\frac{d^2 x^k}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^k_{ij} \frac{dx^i}{d\tau} \frac{dx^j}{d\tau} = 0
$$
